title: MPMD Bed Level Mesh Correction, Inverse Distance Weighted
form_handler: curvefit-inv_dist_wgt.html
curvefit_name: Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation
curvefit_note: >
  <p>The tool constructs a bed mesh by interpolating values from a set
    probed bed measurements or existing values of a bed level mesh.
    Preference is given to probed data over existing bed mesh data.</p>
  <p>The inverse distance weighted interpolation uses a value of 4
    for its power parameter.</p>
