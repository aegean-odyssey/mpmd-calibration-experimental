# [mpmd calibration experimental](https://aegean-odyssey.github.io/mpmd-calibration-experimental)

Here is a [website](https://aegean-odyssey.github.io/mpmd-calibration-experimental) with on-line tools that can be used to post-process the bed-level mesh of the Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer equipped with [`mpmd_marlin_1.1.x`](https://github.com/aegean-odyssey/mpmd_marlin_1.1.x) firmware. This work is purely experimental -- the objective is to develop ways to evaluate and improve the calibration procedures (and maybe a few other things) in the [`mpmd_marlin_1.1.x`](https://github.com/aegean-odyssey/mpmd_marlin_1.1.x) firmware.
