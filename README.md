# mpmd calibration experimental

Here are some scripts that can be used to post-process the bed-level mesh of Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer with [mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware](https://github.com/aegean-odyssey/mpmd_marlin_1.1.x) installed. This work is purely experimental -- the objective is to develop ways to evaluate and improve the calibration procedures in the mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware.

Early _(very early)_ work for an "Online Tools" web version of these scripts can found at
  [MPMD Calibration (experimental)](https://aegean-odyssey.github.io/mpmd-calibration-experimental).
