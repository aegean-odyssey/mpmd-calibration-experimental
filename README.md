# mpmd calibration experimental

Here are some scripts that can be used to post-process the bed-level mesh of Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer with mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware installed. This work is purely experimental -- the objective is to develop ways to evaluate and improve the calibration procedures in the mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware.
