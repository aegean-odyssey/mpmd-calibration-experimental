    <p>This tool scans through the file (e.g. CALIBRAT.TXT) to extract
      basic information such as the firmware version number and the
      printer's configuration and geometry. If the file contains the
      output of an auto-calibration command (G33), these results are
      listed as well.</p>
    <p>The tool also extracts and displays probe results and the bed
      level mesh. If it finds both, it will use the same bilinear z-offset
      correction as the printer to assess the overall "quality" of the
      machine's calibration.</p>
